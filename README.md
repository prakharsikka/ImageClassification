# Image Classification
My first project on image classification with Traffic signs

In this repo, we will build our first image processing project using CNN and understand its power and why it has become so popular. In this article, we will walk through every step of developing our own convolutional model and build our first amazing project.

For the purpose of this exercise we are going to use the traffic signs data which contains images of speed limits, stop signs, directions, speed bumps etc. You can download the data here: https://www.kaggle.com/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign


We are going to use Convolutional Neural network framework and come up with a model with high accuracy and also show how you can simply classify any image basis the model.

Happy MLing!
